Dear {0},

Grace and peace,

Just to let you know that due to another occasion taking place in the church, 
we needed to move the date of the trip to Extreme Edge Rock Climbing to Sunday 30th August. 

So the Sunday School trip is going to be on Sunday 30th August and the bus will leave the church 
at 11:30am and will come back to church at 5pm.

The bus seats are filling up quickly so if you would like your child to find a place please
book asap.
