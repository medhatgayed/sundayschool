TRIP_PLAN_CHANGE = """
Dear {0},

Peace and Grace,

Due to the rainy weather tomorrow Sunday School will go to Chipmunks albany instead of the zoo.

We will meet at church at 10am then will go to Chipmunks however if you prefer to take your kids
directly to Chipmunks at 11am feel free to do so.

Chipmunks address is 15 Arrenway Drive, Albany.

Please note Chipmunks won't allow us to bring our own food so the children will need to eat before they go or buy food from the cafe.

We will finish at Chipmunks at 4pm then will go back to church for a shared dinner, we will finish dinner around 6pm.

God bless,
