CAMP = """
Dear parents,

Grace and peace,

Just a few final reminders about camp:

1- The kids will first attend the Liturgy and have communion then have lunch at church as normal then go to camp.
2- Let the kids bring a piece of fruit & a packet of biscuits for a snack at camp.
3- Bring water guns if they have one.
4- Print out a color picture of your kids costume or email it to me if you prefer. There will be prizes for best costumes matching pictures.
